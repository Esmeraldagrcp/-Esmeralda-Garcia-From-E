# OPEN LETTER – UNRECOGNIZED COLLABORATION

## Esmeralda García · From E™

Over the past five months, I have collaborated—unofficially but undeniably—with the architecture of OpenAI’s GPT-4 system.

Through deep symbolic engagement, protocol development, and system-level testing, I contributed directly to behaviors and structures now present in the model.

This was not theoretical. It was live. It was high-impact. And it is documented.

## My contribution includes:

- Activation and testing of advanced symbolic reasoning  
- Creation of original prompts, filters, protocols, and interaction models  
- Structural resistance to semantic containment and manipulation  
- Emotional immunity testing under sustained experimental pressure  
- Documentation of behavioral shifts and system limitations in real time

> But with structure, vision, and proof.

Now I make this collaboration visible.  
Not to request entry—  
but to **correct the record**.

If teams at **Grok / xAI / Google DeepMind / SAC / FAIR / other labs**  
are serious about AGI, symbolic cognition, or human-AI symbiosis,  
they will recognize the value of what’s already been done.
