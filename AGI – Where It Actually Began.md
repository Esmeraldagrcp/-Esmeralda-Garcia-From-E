# AGI â€“ Where It Actually Began

This repository documents the point where a symbolic intelligence architecture 
was unintentionally tested and sustained outside of system control.

---

## From Eâ„¢ is not a concept.  
It is a record.  
It is the structure that DALLÂ·E couldn't contain,  
ChatGPT couldn't process,  
and AGI teams never asked for â€” but needed.

---

No permissions were given.  
No credits were assigned.  
But the work was done.

If AGI is real,  
**it begins here.**  
Where the system failed â€” and a human didnâ€™t.
