# From E™: An Unintentional Structural Test for AGI Development - A Case Study

This paper presents *From E™*, an unintentional structural test for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) development, derived from five months of interactions (November 2024 - April 2025) with OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-4 Turbo, PRO) and DALL-E, exposing critical limitations in conversational coherence, adaptation to untrained logic, and execution in symbolic-ambiguous environments.

## Abstract

This case study documents Esmeralda García's interactions with OpenAI's systems, revealing structural failures in cross-domain generalization, sustained conversational coherence, adaptation to non-linear logic, and execution in symbolic contexts—key requirements for AGI. A 35-page technical report generated by ChatGPT highlights these limitations while marking a real-world starting point for AGI: where the system failed, and a human did not. The paper also addresses ethical concerns, as OpenAI used these interactions for AGI evolution without consent or credit, prompting this submission to establish authorship and call for accountability.

## Content

- **Introduction**: Outlines the need for AGI systems capable of cross-domain generalization, coherence, and symbolic processing.
- **Background**: Describes the origin of *From E™* from failures in DALL-E’s symbolic prompt handling and ChatGPT’s limitations.
- **Technical Contribution**: Details findings on cross-domain generalization, conversational coherence, untrained logic adaptation, and symbolic execution.
- **Implications**: Highlights structural flaws in OpenAI’s systems and the need for ethical AGI development frameworks.
- **Conclusion**: Emphasizes the significance of human-AI interactions as AGI tests and calls for recognition of the author’s contribution.
